Gambhir was feisty and combative as a batter, determined to prove a point more often than not. McCullum was free-spirited, his enjoyment of the art of batting manifesting itself in all-round aggression. Actually, the two could be peas in a pod – they have extended the same respective batting philosophies to their coaching careers, too.

McCullum, from New Zealand, was appointed the head coach of the England Test team in May 2022 and assumed command of the white-ball sides in September 2024.

Pydantic is a data validation library in Python. It's used by some of the top Python modules out there, notably HuggingFace, FastAPI, and LangChain. Its main benefits are that by modeling your data, you get better IDE support for type-hints and autocomplete. You can also validate your data so that when you create an object, you can be 100% sure that it's valid and it won't fail you later. And finally, if you ever need your data to be in a universal format like JSON, Pydantic gives you an easy way to serialize your objects. This really comes in handy if you need your Python app to talk to other apps on the internet, or if you just want to save your data to disk.

And both of them might work at the beginning. Python will allow you to do this and things can actually seem fine for a while. But eventually, when you do try to use that age variable as a number, it will fail. This can be really hard to debug because the failure could occur at any time in your program. And it could be hard to associate that failure with the actual cause. Luckily, these days, Python has a lot of tools you can use to solve these problems. This includes dataclasses and type-hinting, like in this code example here. But today, we're going to be taking a look at Pydantic.

It gives rich data validation features ensuring that any Pydantic model built will match its model definition. It's also extensible with custom code if the out-of-the-box options aren't enough for your specific needs.\\n\\nThe best part? Its validation rules are declarative, so there's little data validation code to write, and it's much more readable than a bunch of nested if-else statements.

[...] 10 Introduction to the Python Library Pydantic Pydantic includes two primary types of validators: ﬁeld validators ( and model validators ( 5.1 Field validators Field-level validators allow you to define custom logic for individual elds. These validators are declared using the @field_validator decorator. Introduced in Pydantic v2, this decorator must be used in combination with Python's standard @classmethod decorator.\\nExample: from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator class User(BaseModel): username: str @field_validator(\\\"username\\\") @classmethod def validate_username(cls, value): if \\\" \\\" in value: raise ValueError(\\\"Username must not contain spaces\\\") return value In the above example: @classmethod is applied rst.\\nfield_validator decorator contains the eld name to validate.\", \"score\": 0.8877607}, {\"title\": \"Pydantic: A Guide With Practical Examples - DataCamp\", \"url\": \"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pydantic\", \"content\": \"# Pydantic: A Guide With Practical Examples\\n\\nLearn what Pydantic is, what it’s used for, and how it compares to alternatives like Marshmallow or Python’s dataclasses.\\n\\nJun 25, 2025  · 12 min read\\n\\nPydantic is Python’s most popular data validation library that can turn type hints into runtime validation rules.\\n\\nInstead of writing dozens of if `isinstance()` checks and custom validation functions, you define your data structure once using familiar Python syntax.\\n\\nPydantic handles the rest: validating incoming data, converting types when appropriate, and providing clear error messages when validation fails.\\n\\nConsider this simple Python function with type hints and proper documentation: [...] ### Installation and setup\\n\\nSetting up Pydantic is straightforward, but a few common pitfalls can trip up newcomers. I’ll walk you through the proper installation process and help you avoid the mistakes that cause unnecessary debugging.\\n\\nFirst, create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. This prevents version conflicts that can cause mysterious import errors later:\\n\\n```\\n# Create and activate virtual environment (works in zsh and bash) python -m venv pydantic_env source pydantic_env/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux # pydantic_env\\\\Scripts\\\\activate # On Windows\\n```\\n\\nNow, install Pydantic with the following command:\\n\\n```\\npip install pydantic\\n``` [...] ### Pydantic’s features\\n\\nPydantic’s approach gives you several benefits. Performance is the first advantage you’ll notice — Pydantic’s core validation logic is written in Rust, making it faster than hand-written Python validation in most cases. Your application can process thousands of requests without validation becoming a bottleneck.\\n\\nPydantic also allows integration with modern frameworks. FastAPI, one of Python’s fastest-growing web frameworks, uses Pydantic models to automatically generate API documentation, validate request bodies, and serialize responses. When you define a Pydantic model, you get OpenAPI schema generation for free:\", \"score\": 0.8657814}, {\"title\": \"Pydantic: Simplifying Data Validation in Python\", \"url\": \"https://realpython.com/python-pydantic/\", \"content\": \"Pydantic has quickly gained popularity, and it’s now the most widely used data validation library for Python. In this first section, you’ll get an overview of Pydantic and a preview of the library’s powerful features. You’ll also learn how to install Pydantic along with the additional dependencies you’ll need for this tutorial.\\n\\nRemove ads\\n\\n### Getting Familiar With Pydantic\\n\\nPydantic is a powerful Python library that leverages type hints to help you easily validate and serialize your data schemas. This makes your code more robust, readable, concise, and easier to debug. Pydantic also integrates well with many popular static typing tools and IDEs, which allows you to catch schema issues before running your code.\\n\\nSome of Pydantic’s distinguishing features include: [...] Ecosystem and Industry Adoption: Pydantic is a dependency of many popular Python libraries such as FastAPI, LangChain, and Polars. It’s also used by most of the largest tech companies and throughout many other industries. This is a testament to Pydantic’s community support, reliability, and resilience.\\n\\nThese are a few key features that make Pydantic an attractive data validation library, and you’ll get to see these in action throughout this tutorial. Up next, you’ll get an overview of how to install Pydantic along with its various dependencies.\\n\\n### Installing Pydantic\\n\\nPydantic is available on PyPI, and you can install it with pip. Open a terminal or command prompt, create a new virtual environment, and then run the following command to install Pydantic:\\n\\nShell [...] by Harrison HoffmanReading time estimate 34m \\n\\nOne of Python’s main attractions is that it’s a dynamically typed language. Dynamic typing means that variable types are determined at runtime, unlike statically typed languages where they are explicitly declared at compile time. While dynamic typing is great for rapid development and ease of use, you often need more robust type checking and data validation for real-world applications. This is where Python’s Pydantic library has you covered.\", \"score\": 0.8655088}]\n",

      "Pydantic is a powerful Python library designed for data validation and settings management. It leverages Python's type hints to define, parse, and enforce strict typing on data models, making it easier to work with structured and semi-structured data. Pydantic ensures that your application receives data in the correct format, and if the data does not match the defined schema, it raises clear and informative validation errors. This helps reduce debugging time and improves code reliability.\n",

      "Pydantic is widely used in popular Python frameworks like FastAPI, where it helps in validating, serializing, and deserializing data. It also integrates well with Python's type system, providing rich data validation features and allowing for custom validation logic if needed. The library is known for its performance, as its core validation logic is written in Rust, making it faster than hand-written Python validation in most cases.\n",
